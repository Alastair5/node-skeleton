## ERD

### Nouns:

- User (Users/Admins)

  - User_id PK
  - name
  - email
  - password
  - Admin (boolean)

- Posts (items to sell)

  - item_id PK
  - seller_id FK
  - price
  - photo
  - message
  - odometer
  - make
  - model
  - transmission
  - year
  - color
  - description

- Favorites (items to buy)

  - favorite_id PK
  - item_id FK
  - User_id FK

- Use these nouns/entities to build out your database (ie. tables are the nouns from the stories)

## Routes

Once you know the resources that you'll have, write out the routes that you'll need to perform BREAD operations on those resources
Remember RESTful conventions (they make it much easier)

- home "/"
- my listings '/listings'
- specific item listing '/listing/:id'
- inbox '/inbox' ? drop down of recent messages from '/'
- favorites '/favorites'
- new listing '/new'

## MVP vs MVD

There is a concept in development of an MVP, the Minimum Viable Product
An MVP has just enough features to be useful to a User
This concept helps streamline the development process and help keep the team on target
For mid-terms, we want to focus on the MVD, the Minimum Viable Demo
If you aren't going to demo it, don't build it
Wireframes
Draw out the structure of your web pages
This will make it much easier to build out these pages later
This is also a great opportunity to get input from all of the team members
Design matters... however you are a developer, not a designer
Get inspiration from websites you visit

## User Login

Don't do it
Seriously, don't do it
We know that you know how to register and login Users

```js
// do this instead
app.get("/login/:id", (req, res) => {
  // using encrypted cookies
  req.session.User_id = req.params.id;

  // or using plain-text cookies
  res.cookie("User_id", req.params.id);

  // send the User somewhere
  res.redirect("/");
});
```

## Tech Choices

We have made all the tech choices for you
Back End: Node and Express
Front End: HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap
The Mid-term Skeleton
Use the provided node-skeleton as a template for your project
This will get you up and running quickly

## SPA vs Multi-page App

These concepts are not mutually exclusive
You can choose one or the other or both
Git
Use Git best practices (ask a mentor for clarification if you need it)
Use branches
